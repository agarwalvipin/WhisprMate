1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:14,425
SPEAKER_01: Welcome curious minds to another deep dive. Today we're cutting through the noise, getting straight to the core insights you need, especially if you're gearing up for something like the CFA Level 1 exam. We're taking a close look at reading 29 analyzing ballot sheets.

2
00:00:14,627 --> 00:00:35,080
SPEAKER_01: Now, the balance sheet is often called a snapshot, right? But it tells a powerful story about a company's financial health at a specific moment. On-pack its key components, highlight some crucial distinctions and really explore how these concepts directly apply to your exam prep. Our mission. To make you truly well informed, ready to decipher those hidden narratives within the numbers.

3
00:00:35,265 --> 00:01:08,779
SPEAKER_00: Absolutely. Yeah, there are got to be used to clarify the financial reporting and disclosure requirements for some of those tricky about she-dot-ups. Things like intangible assets, goodwill, financial interest. It can be quite nuanced. Also, there are going to comment sizes and also some key ratios show you exactly how to interpret them for your deeper insights into companies with liquidity and sovereignty. And because it's a global exam like the CFA, understand the differences between accounting standards, I4S, USGAP and apply them as vital, we might even use some examples perhaps for a million context to really make these concepts stick.

4
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:42,623
SPEAKER_01: So

5
00:00:48,242 --> 00:00:48,546
SPEAKER_01: Hmm.

6
00:01:08,847 --> 00:01:16,575
SPEAKER_01: Okay, fantastic. Let's unpack this starting with intangible assets. These often feel like the hidden gems on a balance sheet.

7
00:01:16,913 --> 00:01:24,203
SPEAKER_01: non-monitorial assets, no physical substance. Not as obvious as a factory or building you can, you know, walk into, but sometimes incredibly valuable.

8
00:01:24,321 --> 00:01:50,595
SPEAKER_00: Exactly, and what's fascinating and really key for analysis is the distinction between Identifiable and Unidentifiable Intangible Assets. So think of an Identifiable Intangible like a patent for a new drug, maybe developed by an Indian pharma company, or a trademark for a popular beverage brand. As you ask this, you can potentially choir separately. They often have a clear use for life. Then you have the Unidentifiable Kind, which is primarily goodwill.

9
00:01:51,135 --> 00:02:01,564
SPEAKER_00: Goodwill, by its nature, can't really barren its own. The Ruffan has an indefinite wife. In this distinction, it's a common porn-accus fusion, but it's critical because it dictates the accounting.

10
00:02:01,598 --> 00:02:12,752
SPEAKER_01: write the accounting treatment. So how do we differentiate that, say, for a patent with maybe 10-year life versus goodwill, which could theoretically last forever, that seems like it would have a big impact.

11
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:29,324
SPEAKER_00: You've hit on a key point there, and for your CFA exam, definitely a big close attention to this. Firmight lived imcageables, like that happened, or amortized over the years for life. I mean, the value of systematically reduced on the balance sheet, you see the amortization expense hitting the income statement each period.

12
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:32,209
SPEAKER_01: Okay, amortization for finite lived ones.

13
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:41,710
SPEAKER_00: Correct, but indefinitely forms like Goodwill are not amortized. No systematic expense. Instead, they're tested for impairment. Usually, at least once a year.

14
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:44,595
SPEAKER_01: Empowerment testing, so checking if the value has dropped.

15
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:50,738
SPEAKER_00: precisely. If the company figures out the assets value is far more than the budget carrying

16
00:02:50,873 --> 00:03:00,660
SPEAKER_00: Then that reduction hits the income statement as the permanent loss. It can significantly impact reported earnings, and frankly it's often a sign an acquisition didn't work out as planned.

17
00:03:00,677 --> 00:03:14,717
SPEAKER_01: That is a crucial difference. Now, something I've always found, well, interesting, and maybe a bit of a minefield, is how we account for internally developed versus acquired intangibles, especially with those differences between I of RS and US gap. Can you walk us through that?

18
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:24,539
SPEAKER_00: Absolutely and this is critical for any global analysis you do. On your IFRS, research costs, the early stage stuff, or typically expense does include. God.

19
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:39,574
SPEAKER_00: However, development costs think translating research into an actual product design can be capitalized, but only if certain strict criteria are met. Things like showing technical feasibility and the intent to complete it, the ability to actually use or sell the asset.

20
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:43,253
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so IFRS allows capitalizing development costs sometimes.

21
00:03:43,253 --> 00:04:00,060
SPEAKER_00: sometimes yes. But contrast that with US gap. Generally US gap requires expensive bold research and development costs as they happen. There's a specific exception mainly for soft-wooded-out for sale where you can capitalize costs after establishing technological feasibility. But generally it's expensive expensive expensive.

22
00:04:00,044 --> 00:04:03,975
SPEAKER_01: Wow, okay, so that's a pretty big difference, especially for R&D heavy company.

23
00:04:03,975 --> 00:04:04,769
SPEAKER_00: here is the first.

24
00:04:04,937 --> 00:04:12,919
SPEAKER_01: So what does this all mean for the financial statements? If we're trying to compare say a European tech firm using IFRS with a US competitor on GAP.

25
00:04:13,122 --> 00:04:19,534
SPEAKER_00: Without decision capitalized versus expense, it creates ripples everywhere. Makes direct comparison tricky.

26
00:04:19,956 --> 00:04:41,792
SPEAKER_00: If a company capitalizes costs under IFRS, its total assets and equity will look higher in the early years compared to a US gap company dispensing the same costs. The reported net income will also be higher initially. And importantly for cashflow analysis, operating cashflow, see if all. All look better too, because the capitalized cost is treated as an investing outflow, not an operating one.

27
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:44,745
SPEAKER_01: Ah, right, big cash flow classification impact.

28
00:04:44,745 --> 00:04:54,921
SPEAKER_00: Exactly, so you might see US tech firms despite huge innovation, appalling lower assets and maybe lower earnings and those early development phases, compared to some of your PM firms.

29
00:04:56,305 --> 00:05:03,713
SPEAKER_01: As an analyst, you often need to make adjustments sort of normalize these figures to get a true apples to apples comparison. It's a classic CFA exam concept.

30
00:05:03,713 --> 00:05:18,850
SPEAKER_00: Mix it. Now speaking of assets that can really swing the numbers, let's zoom in on the world, you mentioned. It rises from a choir in other business. Could you give us a practical example maybe sticking with that Indian context? Yeah. Sure. Let's imagine a large Indian glamour.

31
00:05:19,424 --> 00:05:26,528
SPEAKER_00: Maybe like the Tadoku? Decides to acquire a small, innovative, e-commerce startup, Beast and Bangalore.

32
00:05:27,186 --> 00:05:55,435
SPEAKER_00: Now, if the price Tata pays is higher than the fair value of all the startups, identifiable assets, it's inventory buildings, maybe even its patents, minus flybodies. Okay, the purchase price is more than the net identifiable assets. Wait, that excess amount. But I guess recorded on Tata's balance sheet, as good will. It represents the value of things you can't quite put your finger on individually. The startup's brand reputation, its loyal customer base, may be expected Synergies, future class savings from

33
00:05:55,435 --> 00:05:57,915
SPEAKER_01: So it's the premium paid for the unseen value.

34
00:05:57,915 --> 00:06:11,078
SPEAKER_00: But this is really us, and like we said, it's an indefinite lived-intangible. No organization, but it absolutely gets tested for a permanent every year. So endless watch that good will figure closely. A big impairment charge can signal trouble with an acquisition.

35
00:06:11,264 --> 00:06:11,702
SPEAKER_01: Got it.

36
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:14,031
SPEAKER_01: Okay, let's shift gears a bit.

37
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:18,672
SPEAKER_01: Moving on to financial instruments, specifically marketable securities.

38
00:06:19,414 --> 00:06:26,232
SPEAKER_01: How do companies classify these? And why does that classification matter so much for analysis? Especially when looking at reported earnings.

39
00:06:26,232 --> 00:06:27,717
SPEAKER_00: So, marriage profoundly.

40
00:06:28,493 --> 00:06:33,539
SPEAKER_00: Because how a company intends to use these securities dictates their accounting treatment.

41
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:36,610
SPEAKER_00: and that falls directly to the balance sheet in the income statement.

42
00:06:37,487 --> 00:06:38,939
SPEAKER_00: Take training securities.

43
00:06:39,124 --> 00:06:44,254
SPEAKER_00: These are instruments bought with the clear intent to solve them in the near future, you know, for a quick profit.

44
00:06:44,693 --> 00:06:49,418
SPEAKER_00: There were poor rumble balance sheet at fair value, the correct market price. And here's the key.

45
00:06:49,755 --> 00:06:56,505
SPEAKER_00: Any unrealized games or losses, need changes in market value before they're sold, go directly through the income statement.

46
00:06:56,505 --> 00:06:58,935
SPEAKER_01: so they directly impact reported profit over law.

47
00:06:58,935 --> 00:07:07,019
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Makes earnings potentially more valuable for market swings. This treatment also applies to most equity securities that have quoted market prices.

48
00:07:07,154 --> 00:07:14,747
SPEAKER_01: Okay, that makes sense for active trading, but then there are available for sale securities. My understanding is, the treatments different there. The gains and losses don't hit the income statement.

49
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:26,121
SPEAKER_00: Correct, this is a really important distinction. Available for sale securities are typically debt securities, but the company doesn't necessarily intend to halt the maturity, but also is an actively trading.

50
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:29,547
SPEAKER_00: They're also reporting that Phil value on the balance sheet.

51
00:07:30,053 --> 00:07:32,652
SPEAKER_00: So, there were you adjusted with my hand.

52
00:07:32,736 --> 00:07:34,862
SPEAKER_01: Okay, fair value on the balance sheet for both.

53
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,567
SPEAKER_00: Yes, but use the default.

54
00:07:37,377 --> 00:07:47,063
SPEAKER_00: The unrealized games and losses for available for sale securities bypass the income statement. Instead, they get reported in other comprehensive income. Or OCI.

55
00:07:47,046 --> 00:07:48,767
SPEAKER_01: OCR, okay, and that flows in.

56
00:07:48,683 --> 00:07:51,012
SPEAKER_00: and you should hold exactly, you'd be killed by it's death.

57
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:58,049
SPEAKER_01: So the logic is to avoid making core earnings volatile because of assets that aren't being actively traded for profit.

58
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:02,959
SPEAKER_00: That's the idea. Keep the income statement cleaner. We're selecting core operations, but...

59
00:08:03,128 --> 00:08:15,362
SPEAKER_00: There's a big butt for analysts. Yeah? Means you can't just look at net income to see the full picture of how you change it. You have to look at OCI and the changing equity to understand the full impact of these securities on the company's wealth.

60
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:05,322
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

61
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:19,564
SPEAKER_01: Right, it complicates things slightly, you need to look beyond just the bottom line profit number.

62
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:29,571
SPEAKER_00: Definitely, it's crucial for assessing true earnings quality and the company's underlying financial strength. A classic case with a balance sheet in equity statement tells a story, netting Cologne does it.

63
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:38,110
SPEAKER_01: And sticky with global standards, what about IFRS? Do they use the same buckets like trading and available for sale? Or is it a different setup?

64
00:08:38,447 --> 00:09:12,332
SPEAKER_00: IFRS uses similar concepts, both slightly different labels and criteria. You'll generally see Securities measure that. One, Amortized Cost. This is mainly for debt instruments, where the planet is just a whole but micro-accompaniment. Similar to US gaps, old, held in maturity. Two, Fair value through other comprehensive income, FIOSCI. This is very much like available for sale. Fair value on the balance sheet, Amurized Games losses in OCI. And three, Fair value through profit or loss, FIETPL. This means trading securities, Fair value changes, HIPAA, and Constable directly.

65
00:08:53,939 --> 00:08:54,141
SPEAKER_01: Hmm.

66
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,669
SPEAKER_01: So the underlying principles are pretty consistent even if the names differ slightly.

67
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:29,562
SPEAKER_00: Probably yes. Fair values increasingly important under both standards, but the specific classification criteria and boundary lines can vary. Definitely something to be aware of for those who are the most comfortable and comfortable people.

68
00:09:29,663 --> 00:09:40,716
SPEAKER_01: Okay, we focused a lot on assets. What about the other side? Liabilities. Specifically non-current liabilities. What's the key takeaway there beyond just knowing their long-term debts?

69
00:09:41,172 --> 00:09:46,437
SPEAKER_00: The name takeaway is understanding the long-term impact of the company's financial structure and risk profile.

70
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:57,895
SPEAKER_00: You met your long term bonds, but typically carried it in a advertised cost. So if a bond was issued in a discount, its value on the balance sheet creeps up over time towards its face value in maturity.

71
00:09:57,945 --> 00:10:00,021
SPEAKER_01: Right, the amodization of the discount opinion.

72
00:10:00,021 --> 00:10:08,189
SPEAKER_00: Exactly, but beyond bonds, you will need to look out for other significant non-coronate abilities too. Things like defund tax like abilities.

73
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:09,960
SPEAKER_01: Ah, this can become planks.

74
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:18,702
SPEAKER_00: they can be a rise from ties with differences between accounting rules and tax rules, and basically signal future tax payments the company expects to make.

75
00:10:18,972 --> 00:10:23,342
SPEAKER_00: A large, accroing deferred tax liability needs investigation.

76
00:10:23,612 --> 00:10:30,717
SPEAKER_00: And then there are things like pension applications. For some all-due established companies, these can be massive and carry significant long-term risk.

77
00:10:30,902 --> 00:10:37,129
SPEAKER_01: So changes in these non-current liabilities can tell you a lot about future cash outflows or shifts in strategy.

78
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:47,001
SPEAKER_00: Absolutely, it's not just about the current debt load, it's about understanding all those long-term commitments and how they shaped the company's financial future and its true

79
00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:47,406
SPEAKER_01: Wait.

80
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:54,274
SPEAKER_01: Now let's get practical with actually analyzing these balance sheets. Comments as balance sheets sound like a really powerful tool.

81
00:10:54,122 --> 00:10:55,489
SPEAKER_00: all the indispensable.

82
00:10:55,439 --> 00:10:55,776
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

83
00:10:55,692 --> 00:11:03,792
SPEAKER_00: A common size balance she takes every single line out of cash, inventory, PPE, debt, equity, everything, and expresses it as a percentage of total assets.

84
00:11:03,792 --> 00:11:05,985
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so everything relative to total assets.

85
00:11:06,205 --> 00:11:11,082
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. It standardizes the whole statement, completely removing the effect of company size.

86
00:11:12,212 --> 00:11:24,649
SPEAKER_00: This means, for your example, any analysis, you can easily compare, say, a small, nembo stutter with a giant Indian multinational like for a lion's interest.

87
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:28,075
SPEAKER_01: Ah, okay, so it allows for direct comparison regardless of scale.

88
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:29,087
SPEAKER_00: I'm sorry.

89
00:11:29,138 --> 00:11:44,055
SPEAKER_00: Or, you can track how a single company's financial structure is wired on debt versus equity. Or, its investment in fixed assets versus current assets has changed over time. Even if the company has gone massively in absolute terms, it will be used to proportions.

90
00:11:44,292 --> 00:11:47,481
SPEAKER_01: So let's take that Mumbai real estate developer example again.

91
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:53,792
SPEAKER_01: From comparing to say Gateway developers and herbal homes, how does common sizing give me deeper insight?

92
00:11:53,792 --> 00:12:01,437
SPEAKER_00: Okay, good example. Imagine you commensize both the balance sheet to see, get what I say, 15% of the task or 10 cash, or help your home to make us 3%.

93
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:02,196
SPEAKER_01: Big difference.

94
00:12:02,196 --> 00:12:10,482
SPEAKER_00: But immediately that common sense comparison gives you a snapshot of your relatively criticality, however, it looks much tighter. But here's the deeper insight potential.

95
00:12:11,157 --> 00:12:20,489
SPEAKER_00: Why does Harbor Homes have left cash? Is it because they're aggressively reinvesting in new projects? Maybe signaling faster growth potential? That could be good.

96
00:12:20,691 --> 00:12:21,400
SPEAKER_00: Yeah

97
00:12:22,092 --> 00:12:29,753
SPEAKER_00: Does it signal their stretched thin, maybe struggling to generate operating cash flow, potentially facing risks if their debt comes to you soon?

98
00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:34,512
SPEAKER_01: Ah, so the common size figure flags the difference, but then you need to dig into the Y.

99
00:12:34,512 --> 00:12:44,249
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. It doesn't give you the answer on its own, but it instantly tells you where to focus your investigation. It points you to the critical questions you need to ask about their strategy at risk.

100
00:12:44,485 --> 00:12:51,859
SPEAKER_01: That makes perfect sense. And this naturally leads us straight into financial ratios, which are, well, absolutely critical for the CFA exam.

101
00:12:52,214 --> 00:12:56,854
SPEAKER_01: What are the main categories we need to grasp from the balance sheet perspective and what are they really telling us?

102
00:12:56,972 --> 00:13:04,043
SPEAKER_00: Absolutely crucial stuff. Barat sheet ratios primarily found at two key categories you need to master. Look what it be in sovancy.

103
00:13:04,043 --> 00:13:05,157
SPEAKER_01: The quality and softness here.

104
00:13:05,157 --> 00:13:07,182
SPEAKER_00: So, liquidity was used.

105
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:15,855
SPEAKER_00: These measure the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations as they come to think paying suppliers, covering paywall maximum.

106
00:13:15,974 --> 00:13:18,015
SPEAKER_01: How easily can they get cash quickly?

107
00:13:18,471 --> 00:13:19,720
SPEAKER_00: Basically, yes.

108
00:13:20,074 --> 00:13:37,185
SPEAKER_00: Key examples for the exam include the current ratio. It's current assets divided by current liabilities. A very common one. Then there's the quick ratio. So it's called the asset test ratio. It's more stringent because it subtracts inventory from current assets before dividing by current liabilities.

109
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:38,586
SPEAKER_01: Why subtract inventory?

110
00:13:38,856 --> 00:13:53,639
SPEAKER_00: Because inventory is not as easily or quickly converted to cash without potentially taking a loss. So the quick ratio gives a tougher measure of immediate liquidity. And even stricter is the cash ratio, just looking at cash and marketable securities relative to current liabilities.

111
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,406
SPEAKER_01: Got a short-term survival matrix essentially.

112
00:13:56,406 --> 00:14:00,254
SPEAKER_00: you can put it that way, and the second category will solve into ratios.

113
00:14:00,405 --> 00:14:08,387
SPEAKER_00: These games, the firms, are building to satisfy its long-term obligations. It's about financial stability over long-haul. Can't handle its debt book.

114
00:14:08,387 --> 00:14:09,585
SPEAKER_01: Okay, long-term health.

115
00:14:09,771 --> 00:14:14,901
SPEAKER_00: Right, these ratios often look at the company's capital structure. It's mix of debt and equity.

116
00:14:14,969 --> 00:14:29,667
SPEAKER_00: Examples include the one-charm that the equity ratio, the total that the equity ratio, and also the financial leverage ratio, which is usually total assets divided by total equity. It shows how much assets are supported by equity versus debt.

117
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:34,729
SPEAKER_01: So these tell you how reliant the company is on borrowing and whether it can sustain that.

118
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:43,538
SPEAKER_00: Exactly, they help you understand the company's financial risk profile. Higher leverage means potentially higher returns things can well, but also much higher risk

119
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,955
SPEAKER_01: Okay, that's clear.

120
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:50,474
SPEAKER_01: But my notes really stress the limitations of ratio analysis. It feels like a really important warning.

121
00:14:50,727 --> 00:14:53,815
SPEAKER_01: Why is that so critical for analysts to keep in mind?

122
00:14:53,933 --> 00:15:05,307
SPEAKER_00: It's a profoundly important point. Wishers are incredibly useful tools, but they are just that tools. They're snapshots based on, potentially, different accounting choices. And they should never be viewed in isolation.

123
00:15:05,357 --> 00:15:06,420
SPEAKER_01: Now the whole picture.

124
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:07,146
SPEAKER_00: Never

125
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:14,267
SPEAKER_00: You absolutely need to compare way sheels over time. For the same company, is it's liquidity improving or deteriorating?

126
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:21,439
SPEAKER_00: You need to compare them against direct industry peers. How does its leverage stack up against competitors facing some more market commissions?

127
00:15:22,182 --> 00:15:29,354
SPEAKER_00: and always, always interpret them within the bratic context of the company's specific industry dynamics and its state and strategy.

128
00:15:29,354 --> 00:15:30,518
SPEAKER_01: Context is key.

129
00:15:30,518 --> 00:15:52,709
SPEAKER_00: Absolutely, and remember our earlier discussion differences in accounting standards, like IFRS versus USGAP, can significantly limit direct compatibility, especially across international firms, you might need to make adjustments. So for your exam and in practice, to take away your one-way shield rarely tells the whole story. High debt to accolade ratio might look a lot minimized solution.

130
00:15:53,046 --> 00:16:02,749
SPEAKER_00: But if it's a capital intensive utility capital with very steel cash flows, maybe it's probably more and more manageable for that industry. If it's a volatile tech startup, maybe it's a huge ref like.

131
00:16:02,749 --> 00:16:06,479
SPEAKER_01: It's about piecing together the evidence for multiple ratios and qualitative factors.

132
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:11,271
SPEAKER_00: precisely. It's about building a comprehensive view. Not why I'm a single number.

133
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:16,637
SPEAKER_01: Wow, okay, that was a really really deep dive into balance sheets. We've covered so much ground.

134
00:16:16,772 --> 00:16:23,354
SPEAKER_01: From the nuances of intangibles and goodwill, those critical distinctions in financial instruments and OCI.

135
00:16:23,472 --> 00:16:31,875
SPEAKER_01: Right through to using common size analysis and key ratios effectively, I think anyone listening is definitely better or quick now to decipher those financial snapshots.

136
00:16:32,078 --> 00:17:04,967
SPEAKER_00: I hope so. And the key thing to remember is that the balance sheet, even though it's static the picture at one point in time, it really offers a dynamic understanding of a company's financial structure, its choices, and its risk profile when you analyze it properly. For your CFA exam, mastering these concepts isn't just about memorizing formulas like the current ratio or whatever. It's about developing that amylo-like mindset, it's about connecting the dots between these different elements, and understanding their implications for a company's past performance, its current health, and crucially its future prospects. Seeing the story behind the numbers.

137
00:17:05,204 --> 00:17:05,980
SPEAKER_01: Absolutely.

138
00:17:06,182 --> 00:17:33,250
SPEAKER_01: So, as you continue your prep for the CFA exam and beyond, here's something I think about, a provocative thought perhaps. How might a company's fundamental strategic choices say, choosing to prioritize aggressive internal R&D, like a former company developing new drugs in-house, versus growing through buying other companies? How might those very different strategies be subtly, yet significantly reflected across its balance sheet? Think about the impact on intangibles, goodwill, maybe even cash levels?

139
00:17:33,435 --> 00:17:35,309
SPEAKER_01: and how would discerning their choices?

140
00:17:35,494 --> 00:17:46,125
SPEAKER_01: perhaps by comparing their capitalization policies under IFRS versus GAP, or tracking their goodwill balance? How would that enhance your ability to forecast its long-term financial health and its competitive standing?

141
00:17:46,514 --> 00:17:49,956
SPEAKER_01: Keep digging into those numbers because as you said, that's where the real insights are hiding.

142
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:58,934
SPEAKER_01: That's all for this deep dive. We really hope this exploration of balance sheets helps you ace that exam and gives you valuable tools for your analysis toolkit. See you next time.
